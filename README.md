# BIOS620 Final Project

This repository contains code and slides for the final project in **BIOSTAT 620 Introduction to Health Data Science**.

## Project Title
**Analysis of the COVID-19 Cases Rate and Excess Mortality Rate by Pandemic Wave**

## Summary
We investigate how COVID-19 case rates relate to excess mortality across different pandemic waves in the U.S. Using CDC and Census Bureau data, we:
- Divide the timeline into three distinct waves.
- Analyze mortality and case trends by state and wave.
- Fit and compare linear, LOESS, and spline regression models.
- Assess model performance in cross-wave predictions using RMSE and RÂ² metrics.
